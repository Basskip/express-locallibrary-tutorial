# Local Library Express Tutorial

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/express-101) curriculum, working through MDN's [express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) to start learning Node + Express

## Things I learned
* The basics of routing, templates and CRUD in Express
* A bit of how Pug/Jade works for templating
* Using express-validator for validation and sanitizing user input

## Things to work on
